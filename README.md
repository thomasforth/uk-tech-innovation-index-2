# uk-tech-innovation-index-2
UK Tech Innovation Index 2 is an output of [The Data City](http://www.thedatacity.com) and the first refresh of [the UK Tech Innovation Index](http://odileeds.org/projects/uk-tech-innovation-index/).

We take a new approach to measuring the capacity for innovation in UK technology/industry by leaving behind traditional city definitions and creating clusters based on the location of events, scientific publications, and businesses, and the strength of links between them. More is explained in our blog on [Geography, Clusters and Clustering](http://thedatacity.com/blog/#Clusters).

Clusters are examined in five areas inspired by the [UK Government's Industrial Strategy White Paper 2017](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-strategy-building-a-britain-fit-for-the-future), Artificial intelligence and Data, Clean Growth, Smart Cities and Mobility, Ageing Society, and Advanced manufacturing.

## Three outputs
* **Cluster outlines** (as GeoJSON files) are available for each of the five industrial categories are available for re-use under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
* **Cluster scores**, cluster centroids, and name of the cluster for each cateogy is available for re-use under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
* **Lists of geolocated events, papers, and businesses** that act as the basis for clustering (links between events are removed for publication) are available in CSV format but should not be considered open data. Events are from a variety of sources including Eventbrite, Open Tech Calendar, and Meetup and are shared with all detail removed to respect the terms of access to them. Scientific publications are from Academic Knowledge and shared with limited details for the same reason. Businesses are shared in similar detail to events and papers for consistency. The unclear and complex licensing of the some of the source data means that we urge caution in re-using this data.
